\section{Remaining flaws}

In this section other flaws that I detected are described along with some ideas
to fix them and to improve the code overall.

\subsection*{SQL driver}

The SQL driver is hard-coded to the HyperSQL JDBC driver, what if we want to use
another type of SQL database (e.g. MySQL)? We could add two properties in
\emph{web\_portal.cfg} which would then be used in the \emph{getConnection()}
method of \emph{SQLDatabase} to retrieve the JDBC driver and the subprotocol
(e.g. in \emph{jdbc:hsqldb:...}, \emph{hsqldb} is the subprotocol).

\subsection*{XML}
As of now, XML pages are created with the help of XSLT which transforms the
given XML input into an HTML page by using an XSL document
(\emph{web\_portal.xsl}).\\

It is great, except that the XML input is produced by concatenating Strings
(e.g. Data, Pages). It is not a real problem in the current situation, because
the strings are small.
But we could use an XML builder (e.g. dom4j \cite{cite:dom4j}) to produce these
documents. First, the code would be easier to read, and secondly, it would be
useful to reuse XML parts.
