\subsection{JSONDatabase implementation}

First of all, the \emph{softarch.portal.db.json} package as well as the
\emph{JSONDatabase}, \emph{JSONDatabaseFactory}, \emph{RawJSONDatabase},
\emph{RegularJSONDatabase}, \emph{UserJSONDatabase} classes were
created. There is not much to say about the first 2 classes since they
are similar to the SQL ones. As for \emph{RawJSONDatabase} and
\emph{RegularJSONDatabase}, all their methods throw the following exception
since the assignement subject specified that we did not have to implement them.\\

\begin{lstlisting}
    throw new DatabaseException("not implemented");
\end{lstlisting}
\

Only the methods from the \emph{UserJSONDatabase} class were developed.
By doing so, we want to be able to create subscriptions
(\emph{FreeSubscription}, \emph{CheapSubscription},
\emph{ExpensiveSubscription}), login and logout.\\

The \emph{gson} library is used to parse and write JSON files. The lirary's jar
(\emph{gson-2.3.1.jar}) was added to the \emph{WebContent/WEB-INF/lib}
directory.
